### 1. Introduction

Wild boars ranges extend over large parts of Europa and Asia. In Switzerland most wild boar populations live in the Mittelland, Jura and parts of Tessin and Rhonetal. The typical habitat of wild boars is the forest and the upper altitude during summer, where wild boars can be found, ranges from 2000-4000 m.s.l. Wild boars have the ability to adapt themselves to new habitats. Agricultural areas are used by wild boars for feeding. If the vegetation is dense and higher than 70 cm, they also like to use them as hiding places (WildLife Solutions, 2021). Keuling et al. suggest an increase in wild boar populations due to higher temperatures during winter months, better access to food and wrong regulations measures (2016). These circumstances lead to more frequent conflicts between agriculture and wildlife. In 2020, Chf 95'000.- worth of damage was caused by wild boars in the canton of Fribourg (Amt für Wald und Natur, 2021). Therefore the number of hunted wild boars in Switzerland also increased from 60 in 1970 to 12996 in 2019 (Bundesamt für Statistik, 2020).

Researchers at ZHAW developed an acoustic measure to keep wild boars away from agricultural. Speakers located near agricultural zones chase away wild boars with warning signals (anthropogenic sounds). During this project GPS data of several wild boars were collected (ZHAW, 2019). We use this data to get a better insight about the spatial patterns of wild boar movements. Therefore we came up with the following two research questions:

-   RQ1: How can trajectories be modeled to find similarity in movement?

-   RQ2: How can common corridors used by several animals be detected?

To answer both research questions a raster and grid combination (Fig. 1) will be used to reduce the spatial accuracy and to increase the performance of the calculations. The black boxes in Fig. 1 represent the raster with a 1000 m resolution. The purpose of the raster is to split the trajectories of wild boars into fragments. The red boxes represent the grid with a 50 m resolution. The purpose of the grid is to reduce the spatial resolution of the GPS data. Movement within a grid cell cannot be distinguished anymore. GPS coordinates are replaced by grid cell names (A1, A2 etc.). The colorful lines in Fig. 1 represent the movement of unique wild boars.

To answer RQ1 we will use the Edit Distance method to compare the similarity of two trajectories. The adist() tool in R calculates the number of edits needed to make two trajectories identical. The trajectories with the least amount of edits needed, are most similar to each other. Fig. 2 visualizes the process behind adist().

To answer RQ2 sequences of most frequently visited grid cells are calculated. The word corridor should not be confused with structures that allow animals to cross anthropogenic barriers. The temporal component of different trajectories is not taken into account. Only the total frequency of grid cells over the whole time period is decisive.

### 2. Data and Methods

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#install.packages("devtools") 
#devtools::install_github("ComputationalMovementAnalysis/ComputationalMovementAnalysisData")
#install.packages("simplevis")
library(simplevis)
library(ComputationalMovementAnalysisData)
library(sf)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(sp)
library(rgdal) 
library(raster)
library(ggplot2)
library(leaflet)
library(shiny)
library(tidyr)
library(stringdist)
```

**Step 0: Data**

The dataset contains spatio-temporal information about 19 different wild boars. The sex can be derived form the animal names. No age information is provided. The observed time periods are of different lengths for the respective animals. Earliest records are from 28.05.2014 and latest records are from 18.10.2016. A location update is provided roughly every 15 min. The tracked animals mostly moved around in the Berner Seeland, the area around lake Neuchâtel, lake Biel and lake Murten. The Bernese part of the Seeland in particular has been considered Switzerland's "vegetable garden" since the regulation of the Aare(FDCH, 2021).

Schritte evtl. bisschen genauer beschreiben!

```{r}
boars <- wildschwein_BE
head(boars)
```

Export as .csv

```{r}
# Optional, to take a look at the data with QGIS 
write.csv(boars, "boars.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

**Step 1: Raster**

Telling R that E and N are coordinate columns

```{r}
boars$E <- as.integer(boars$E)
boars$N <- as.integer(boars$N)
coordinates(boars) <- boars[,c(5, 6)]
```

Telling R that our points are in LV95 and check

```{r}
proj4string(boars) <- CRS("+init=epsg:2056")
is.projected(boars)
```

Creating a Raster over the extend of our boar location points

```{r}
r <- raster(ext=extent(boars))

# Setting the raster cell size 
res(r) <- 1000
r
```

1000m results in 13\*10 cells

Add raster coordinate info to column

```{r}
boars$raster_E <- ((boars$E - r@extent@xmin) %/% ((r@extent@xmax - r@extent@xmin)/ r@ncols)) # (Koordinate - Minimum Extent) // cellsize 
boars$raster_N <- ((boars$N - r@extent@ymin) %/% ((r@extent@ymax - r@extent@ymin)/ r@nrows))
```

**Step 2: Grid**

Preparing to add a grid for each raster cell

```{r}
# Getting boundries for the loop
minE <- min(boars@data$raster_E)
maxE <- max(boars@data$raster_E)
minN <- min(boars@data$raster_N)
maxN <- max(boars@data$raster_N)

# Empty Vectors to be appended to in the loop, to add the grid Coordinates to the boars df after the loop ran
grid_E <- c()
grid_N <- c() 
```

Loop to create grid coordinates

```{r}
for (E_n in minE:maxE)
{
  for (N_n in minN:maxN)
  {
  
    # Doing the same as for the Raster now in every Raster cell (rcell), calling it Grid (g)
    rcell <- boars@data %>% filter(raster_E == E_n, raster_N == N_n)
    if (nrow(rcell)>0){ # Disregarding no or just single locations, as no strings can be built in those raster cells
      coordinates(rcell) <- rcell[,c(5, 6)]
      g <- raster(ext=extent(r@extent@xmin + 1000*E_n, r@extent@xmin + 1000*E_n + 1000, r@extent@ymin + 1000*N_n, r@extent@ymin + 1000*N_n + 1000)) # Create the grid, setting the extent to the corresponding raster cell
      res(g) <- 50 # Setting the Grid resolution here, the 1000m Raster Cell is divided by this.
      rcell$grid_E <- ((rcell$E - g@extent@xmin) %/% ((g@extent@xmax - g@extent@xmin)/ g@ncols)) 
      rcell$grid_N <- ((rcell$N - g@extent@ymin) %/% ((g@extent@ymax - g@extent@ymin)/ g@nrows))
      grid_E <- append(grid_E,rcell$grid_E) 
      grid_N <- append(grid_N,rcell$grid_N)
    } 
  }
}
```

Append grid coordinate vectors to the boars spdf

```{r}
boars@data$grid_E <- grid_E
boars@data$grid_N <- grid_N
```

**Step 3: Create Chess Strings per Raster Cell & Animal**

```{r}
# Append all Information to a new DF containing our "Chess Strings"

# Creating empty df to later append to
empty_vector = c("Beispiel",0,0,"A1b2")
name_vector = c("TierName","raster_E","raster_N","ChessString")
#create a data frame out of a transposed vector
chess_boars = as.data.frame(t(empty_vector));
#change the names of the dataframe to be the titles
colnames(chess_boars) <- name_vector;

```

Creating the ChessStrings (This Loop takes a few seconds to run)

```{r}
for (E_n in minE:maxE)
{
  for (N_n in minN:maxN)
  {
    if (unique(boars@data$TierName)[1] > 0){
      for(name in unique(boars@data$TierName)){
        filter <- boars@data %>% filter(raster_E == E_n, raster_N == N_n, TierName == name)
        if (nrow(filter) >0) {
          filter$grid_E <- replace(filter$grid_E, filter$grid_E <1, 26) # setting -1 and 0 to z
          filter$grid_E <- replace(filter$grid_E, TRUE, letters[filter$grid_E]) # Turn Eastings into letters
          filter$coord <- paste(filter$grid_E, filter$grid_N, sep="") # Paste Eastings and Northings into one column
          
          coordf<- data.frame(filter$coord)
          ChessString <- paste(coordf[,1], collapse = "")
          
          supplemental_vector = c(name, E_n, N_n, ChessString)
          
          # Appending the Vector to the chess_boars df
          supplemental_data_frame <- data.frame(t(supplemental_vector));
          colnames(supplemental_data_frame) <- name_vector;
          chess_boars <- rbind(chess_boars, supplemental_data_frame);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```{r}
# Removing the row used to create the df
chess_boars <- chess_boars[-c(1),] 
```

**Step 4: Calculate Corridors**

```{r}
#Count unique combinations of columns raster_E, raster_N, grid_E and grid_N
PopularRasterGrids <- dplyr::count_(boars@data, vars = c("raster_E","raster_N","grid_E","grid_N"))
PopularRasterGridsByName <- dplyr::count_(boars@data, vars = c("TierName","raster_E","raster_N","grid_E","grid_N"))

```

```

Export data to run Loop to calculate EditDistance in IPython (see separate file wbc_loop.ipynb) --\> we did this, since we were not able to vectorize the functionality of the loop and python (pandas) performs better handling such large loops then R

```{r}
write.csv(WBC_chess, "wbc.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

Import data again.

```{r}
EditDistance <- read.csv("edc.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

Add EditDistance row sum column.

```{r}
EditDistance$row_sum = rowSums(df1[,c(-1)])
```

### 3. Results

```{r}

```

Tab. 2 Similarity of wild boar movement

### 4. Visualisation

The initial goal was to create a interactive map with RShiny and Leaflet. Check boxes would have enabled the display of one or multiple wild boar trajectories. The grid and the background map would have increased the orientation in space. But Leaflet only accepts EPSG: 4326 (Agafonkin, 2016). But our map depends on EPSG: 2056, as the raster and grid were calculated in meters. A simple visualisation was therefore realised in QGIS. A .csv per wild boar was created in R and the Points to Path tool in QGIS was used to convert the points to lines (trajectories). The raster and grid were created with the mmQGIS plugin.

The QGIS project can be accessed as a geopackage from our repository.

### 5. Discussion

**General description of wild boar trajectories**

Most of the wild boars seem to use the Seewald next to lake Neuchâtel as a homebase. This makes sense, because the typical habitat of wild boars is the forest. The movement of Sabine, Olga, Nicole, Joana, Isabelle, Gaby, Fritz and Eveline is mostly restricted to the Seewald. Those are quite a few animals for such a small forest, as the area is only around 2.5 km\^2. Wild boars usually live in herds and the family groups are led by a female animal. Male boars usually live as solitary animals and only visit the herds during the mating season (Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Ernährung, Landwirtschaft und Forsten, n.d.). Most of the animals in the Seewald are females. The reeds by the lake offer a good retreat, as they are often nature reserves (BauernZeitung, 2019). The biggest advantage of this forest are probably the surrounding agricultural areas. Wild boars cause a lot of damage, as the fields provide an easy source of food ( rc, 2018; Bieler Tagblatt, 2020). Amos, Caroline, Donar, Franz, Rosa and Ueli did spend more time on agricultural fields than other animals. The trajectory of Franz in Fig. 3 shows his movement on agricultural land. The area next to Witzwil was extensively visited by Franz. Fig. 3 also shows how the railway track acts as boarder. Franz and Ueli mainly move around in the open agricutural areas. Frida, Amos and Miriam have a homebase in the Seewald and Reservat Fanel.

**Similarly moving wild boars**

We will update this section until tomorrow.

**Frequently visited corridors**

Tab. 1 contains a frequency count of all unique raster and grid combinations. From our definition a corridor exists, if adjacent grid cells have a high frequency count. Raster in the center of the map are more popular, as most animals mainly move between lake Murten and lake Neuchâtel. Outer raster cells and raster cells over water bodies have a low frequency counts. The grid cell with the highest frequency count is located in raster (6/7) and grid cell (2/0). But explicit corridors are not visible at first sight, as the grid cells with the highest frequency counts are not located next to each other. Possible reasons for the non existence of corridors are: The topography of the study area is very flat and the land cover is generally open and accessible. Therefore animals can move around freely and if free movement is possible animals do not tend to walk in straight lines (corridors). If animals move next to a straight object, which can not be crossed (canal, railway track), corridors are probably more common. Larger grid cells might deliver better results. The temporal resolution (15min) of the movement data is probably not high enough to detect corridors. Our method is suitable to create Kernel Density Maps representing the frequency of visited grid cells.

**Limitations**

The calculations for the similarity analysis took very long. A more efficient algorithm could decrease the run time. We tried to tackle this problem by using raster cells, which reduce the length of trajectories. But R is not very efficient with for loops. A faster algorithm would enable a variation of the grid size and the outputs could be compared with a sensitivity analysis. A grid cell approach in combination with a rather low temporal resolution of the dataset is probably not the best method to detect corridors.
