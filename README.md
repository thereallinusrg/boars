## Abstract 

<!-- A short abstract of your project proposal (50-60 words) -->


## Research Questions

<!-- What are the research questions of your project? (50-60 words) -->
**Similarly Moving Boars**
- Which animals move similarly?
  - Even at different times!
**Corridor Detection**
- Which animals use the same corridors?
  - Where are those located?

## Results / products

<!-- Which results/products do you expect, anticipate? -->

## Data

<!-- What data will you use? Will you require additional context data? Where do you get this data from? Do you already have all the data? -->

## Analytical concepts

<!-- Which analytical concepts will you use? What conceptual movement spaces and respective modelling approaches of trajectories will you be using? What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## R concepts

<!-- Which R concepts, functions, packages will you mainly use. What additional spatial analysis methods will you be using? -->

## Risk analysis
